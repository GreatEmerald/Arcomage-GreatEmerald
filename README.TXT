This is a readme file for the whole Arcomage Clone project. Please take your
time to read through the readmes, since there is valuable information inside.

The Arcomage Clone project aims to bring you the experience of Arcomage, a card
game developed by New World Computing and 3DO, first as a minigame in Might and
Magic VII, then with bonus cards in Might and Magic VIII and finally as a
standalone game. This project, however, is free and open source, as well as
cross-platform. It also contains enhancements over the original Arcomage, such
as support for custom cards and hotseat multiplayer. The project strives to be
true to the original, however, and so the owners of either Might and Magic VIII
or the standalone Arcomage game will be able to enjoy the original Arcomage
experience, while others will see remade graphics and sounds.

This project is split to three parts: arcomage, clarcomage and libarcomage.
libarcomage is a backend library, written purely in D. arcomage and clarcomage
are frontends, the former being the SDL graphical frontend and the latter being
a CLI frontend written in D.

If you are an end-user, you will need to install both libarcomage and
arcomage/clarcomage in order to play the game. If you are a developer, you will
be able to use libarcomage to include the game in your own program or create a
frontend for it.

For more information about the different parts of the project, see the readmes
in their respective directories.
